# Project Name

We are doing a Javascript Pizzeria.
You enter a virtual Pizzeria and order your food.

## The problem

I followed the steps in the instructions and used alert() and prompt() methods.
There where some things that I needed Google for to figure out why certain things are working or not.
After using both the if...else statements and switch statement I learned that for certain things one or the other might be better to use.
If I would have more time I would go over the code to make it easier and brush up on the styling.
