# Project Name

This week was my first time coding in JS and it was a great start!
This project is a JS pizzeria, where you can "order" from a menu by jumping trought interactive windows in the brouser.

## The problem

The main problem was to starting from 0 to get to learn the different data types in JS, how to use them implement them...
I did follow Technigos recomendations as well as chatGPT as a conssiten assitant.
I see the improvement I have dome using VSC shortcuts and this is making my coding experience much comfortable and enjoyable.

In this practice, we used some data types like: variables if, else if, else, switch and some methods.
I looKing forward to know more about arrays, functions and objects and how to implement them.
