# Project Name

Create a simple food ordering system in js, by following the instructions.

## The problem

I followed the instructions. First, I used switch before realizing that would be a stretch. Finished using conditional if statements and later created a separate switch solution.

I focused on going step by step and not changing the flow. 

As a stretch I played around with displaying the order in the site (in the switch file). 

Will also make an attempt with more loops for validation, in case the user input is incorrect. If I have time, I will explore a third solution with the menu as an object, which seems cool.

Before hand in I will go through it again to make it DRY and cleaner.
