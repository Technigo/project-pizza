# Project Pizza

This project was started by reading through the instruction and also browsing through the examples.
Then, I started with the script.js file which contains several IF/ELSE and also the code was a bit repetitive.
After finishing the script.js, I started working on switch.js and the aim of that is to make the code cleaner and most importantly, change all the IF/ELSE statements into SWITCH statements.

## The problem

I approached this project by sketching the flowchart. Followed by the flowchart, I started building each block by block. The highlight of this project is I built sort of validation, that prevents the user from proceeding until they input what we deem is valid.
Moreover, this project used recursive function that is a function calls itself inside itself. Though I might have neglected some technical or backend limitations, it still seems a good practice at least for this small project.
