Pizza order in restaurant.

## The problem

This project involves creating a JavaScript program that guides users through an interactive ordering process in five key steps. It begins with a warm welcome and introduction, utilizing the alert() and prompt() methods to engage the user. Following this, users make food selections from a provided menu using the prompt() method, with their choices confirmed using alert(). The program then adapts to the chosen food type, prompting for subtype selections and providing feedback through alert(). Age specification is then requested, leading to a constructed order message displayed via alert(). Finally, the user's order is confirmed based on their previous choices, with a gratitude or farewell message presented accordingly. The project also offers a stretch goal of refactoring the code for enhanced readability and maintainability using JavaScript's switch case structure, with both versions accessible for comparison.
