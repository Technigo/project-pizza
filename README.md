# Build a JavaScript Pizzeria

This week's project is to build a website where you can order food by clicking through a number of choices. If the order goes well, the procedure ends with the user confirming or canceling the order.

## The problem

Alerts and prompts are used to interact with the user, information about the user's choices is saved in variables.
Depending on the choices the user makes, the order flow takes different paths, this is handled with conditional statements such as switch and if statements.

## View it live

You can try ordering food yourself here:
