# Project Name

This project was a part of the first sprint of the Technigo web developer bootcamp and the aim was to learn basic Javascript concepts like variables, conditionals and native methods.  

## The problem
Using conditional operators as if/else statements, switch statements and ternary statements the user gets to choose between dishes and different subcategories. The hardest part was to get dry code for a switch statement where the user got to chose 1, 2 or 3 for a subcategory of the main dishes pizza, pasta and salad. First I declared the chosen subtype with a long if/else statement (chosing the main dish) with several switch statements within it (chosing the subtypes). The code was very repetative. After realising I could declare the subtype variables with arrays and then simply selecting the subtype by chosing the array placement, it made the code a lot more dry.

In this challenge I also learned the prompt method to collect input data from the user and store it in a variable.
