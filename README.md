# Bella Italia Pizzeria

The task is to create a order functionality for a fictional pizzeria using JavaScript concepts like variables, conditionals and native methods.

## The problem

I started with the basic logic and tried to get that to work. After that was working I started looking into how I could improve my code. I wanted to make sure the prompt asked again when the user had an invalid option and also that it would stop executing the code if the user clicked "Cancel".

I also did the stretch goals and did a version where I use 'switch' instead of if/else statements.
