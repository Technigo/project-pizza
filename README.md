# Project Name

This project is a web-based application designed to simulate a food ordering system for a fictional Pizzeria. The primary goal is to provide an interactive experience for users to select their preferred food items, specify details such as type and quantity, and complete their order with an automated pricing system based on their selection and user category (adult or child).

## The problem

The main challenge was to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that guides the user through the ordering process without overwhelming them with options or requiring extensive input.
