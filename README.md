# Project Name

After going through the material in Notion, I started researching JavaScript variables and alerts online and then testing a bunch of stuff myself before joining the coding session. I learned a lot by just testing a couple of things myself, and I found it really fun to just go crazy with the different variables and commands until something stuck.

## The problem

I had some issues with the switch-tags, but I changed the order flow a bit to make it work smoother, and that worked wonders.
