# Trattoria Pizzeria

The task was to create an interactive JavaScript-based food ordering system where users select their name, food choices, and order details. The solution is built using JavaScript's alert() and prompt() methods to interact with the user. Conditional statements were used to handle different choices.

The project consists of five steps:

-Welcome and Introduction: Welcoming the user and collecting their name.
-Food Choice: Letting the user select a food type (Pizza, Pasta, Salad).
-Subtype Choice: Choosing a subtype based on the previous food choice.
-Age Confirmation: Confirming whether the food is for an adult or a child.
-Order Confirmation: Asking the user to confirm their order or decline.

## The problem

The approach to the problem was structured into logical steps, focusing on user interaction through prompts and alerts. Each step progressively built on the previous one, guiding the user through a food ordering process.

Planning:

- Background Image: Preloaded to ensure smooth user experience.

- Input Handling: Designed a reusable getValidSelection() function to validate user choices for food and subtypes.

- Iterative Process: Built the order process step by step (welcome, food choice, subtype, age, confirmation).

- Edge Case Handling: Added error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric age, incorrect food options).

Technologies:

JavaScript, HTML, CSS
