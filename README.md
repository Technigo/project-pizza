# Project Name

This is an javascript pizzeria "machine" built so you can order pizza, pasta or salad online.

## The problem

It is built mainly with methods like alert() and prompt() and with Conditional statements to tie the answers from the prompts() (that are stored in variables) together.
This was a tought nut to crack and it took a few rounds of thinking (and some help from the team) to get it working. The toughest though I think was how to actually think of the problem before starting to code. I started the coding first and noticed that I had to redo it all almost on every step. Which made me realise the importance of writing down the solution in text first.
