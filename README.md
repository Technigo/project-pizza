# Project Name

Create a simple food ordering system in js, by following the instructions.

## The problem

I followed the instructions as closely as possible. Wrote down all the steps as comments and "filled them in".
First, I started using switch before realizing that would be a stretch. Finished basic scope using conditional if statements and later created a separate switch solution. I focused on going step by step and not changing the flow.

For stretching I focused mainly on the switch version.
I tried to cover "invalid" inputs and catch if the user wanted to exit/cancel.
Played around with displaying the order in the site.

If I have time, I will explore a third solution with the menu as an object.
