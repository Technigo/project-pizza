# Project Name
I have done an "order-sheet" where a user can make an order from a pizzeria/restaurant. There are 3 different types of food; pizza, pasta, salad. There are 3 menu alternatives for each food type, and the user will be asked to type their age so that the system can determine the size and price of the order. 


## The problem
I have used if and else-loops to create a system where there would be different outcoumes based on the user's answer. 
Before I started with my code, I tried to create a plan in my head for what scenarios could be likely and thereby which different kinds of loops I needed to create. I tried to keep it as simple as possible with the variables and if's and else's, and name them in a way that someone else going through the code would understand. 

If I would re-do this project, I think I could have simplified the loops even more, perhaps I could have created less variables and re-use the ones already created, and make the code more comprehensible.
