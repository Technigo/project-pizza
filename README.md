# Project Pizza

We were going to try to make an online pizzeria where people can order pizzas.

## The Problem

I looked at other examples that we have done through the course to see if there were anything that we coded that looked like this project. We had a "Music Project" that looked a lot like this one. So I took what I could from that code and tried to fix the things that didn't look like the code my self.

If I had more time I think I wold make the site look a bit nicer.
