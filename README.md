# Project Name

This is Technigo's project for the first week. The premise is pretty simple, we have to create a 
pizzeria order page, getting the user's selection through JS prompts. 

## The problem

There's a very simple way of doing this. We could just do a series of if/else statements and/or
switch statements. I tried to make this a bit more complicated by storing the menu options in JS 
Objects and dynamically generating the menu options.

There's still a couple of things in this project that is hardcoded but it's possible to refactor this
so that there's minimal hardcoding involved and everything is generated based on the JS Objects. Doing it this way will make future updates easy as we will only need to update the JS Objects should
there be menu changes.
