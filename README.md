# Pizza-bot-Project

In this project I have been built a Javascript Pizzeria. 

## The problem

To interact with the user, I used the prompt() and alert() methods. 
I used if, else-if and else statements to make choices and I used while statements to make sure that the given information by the user is valid.
Challenging for me was to think through the different options and how to organize and write them in a good way.
