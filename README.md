## The problem

Before I started, I simplely thought I can only use if... else statement to write. But when I started to implement. I realized :

1. I understand if...else and switch stament, as well as array. But when I worte this project. I stucked. I did not know how to combine them together. Then I learned from the live session, I was told that switch can be nested.
   I also back to read the concept of Switch and array. Because before the project, I only knew the "shape" of switch and array. Now understand each case of switch is the value of the variable, when the variable equals one of the value, the code will execute the statement of the value.
2. For the array, before the live session and saw coach was using the index to express the value, I used the same way of switch, that somehow wasted my time and made the code looks so complecated. And I had to write alert for each switch(subtypeMenu). Now I combine the switch and if...else statement, use array index to express the subytype selection, it made the code much cleaner as well as my mind.

3. Now I understand === and =, avoid to use ==. I can check the data type by console.log("string", variable, typeof variable). It helped me to make sure which data type I am using now.

4. From the step 4, I stucked again and struggled a while. I knew that how to ask age by alert, but I did not know how to add the order food on the alert, e.g. "Your adult sized Spaghetti will be prepared". I tried different ways but failed, then cam back to step 3 -- the alert of subtype selection, made a nest if...else statement. I don't know whether it is the best solution, I believe there will be a better solution to write the code cleaner and easier to read.
