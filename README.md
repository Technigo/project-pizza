# Project Name

For this project #4 we focused on basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditionals, and native methods, Using alert() and prompt() to collect information from our customers

## The problem

This time I was very focus in all the information we got from Disco, and I was focusing in 1 step at the time. I started by trying to understand the logic of each element, such as =, ==, ===, let, const, etc. 

I would say that 90% of the time I was reading and collecting information from W3school and stack overflow, I tried to use chatgpt but sometimes it was giving me a very different way of building the project, I believe with more advance variables and conditionals.

If I had more time I would like to make it with the options that chatgpt suggested to see if it work better.
