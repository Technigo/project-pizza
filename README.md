A site where you can order food with JavaScript

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I realised that I wanted a loop that continued to ask the costumer for their choice of food, untilthey wrote a valid answer. So I had to google how to do that (w3school was helpful). Then I had to try a few different versions of my code before i finally worked (For example: Setting foodChoice to null in wait of an answer did not work. Setting it to "Apple" worked.).
