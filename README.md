# Project Name

A basic project meant to showcase a basic understanding of conditionals. One way to run the code is through if/else statements in script.js and the other is through switch-cases in switch.js.

## The problem

It seemed to be relatively straight forward to ask questions through prompts so the different options were provided and some sort of answer validation was attempted to ensure only "proper" answers would be accepted.
The most difficult part was to find a way to keep the rest of the code from running once an incorrect answer had been provided. In attempting to not use if/else in switch.js, a lot of code was repeated which is something that I would normally attempt to refrain from. I also think that nesting as much as I did is suboptimal, but it was the solution I came up with and, while suboptimal, does what it needs to do.
