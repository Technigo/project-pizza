# Project Name

Goal of this project is to learn the basics of JavaScript by creating a virtual pizzaria ordering platform with simple inputs.

## The problem

First I had to get familiar with the JS functions.
I tried to use first if and else if functions. After I changed moste of the part with switch. I left the only if function for the pricing calculation.
My problem currently is that the loop is not perfect.
