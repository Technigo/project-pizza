# Project Name

The assignment was to use basic JavaScript to make it possible to order food from a pizzeria website.

## The problem

I started by going through this week material again regarding if .. else if and else-statements. Then I coded one step at a time going through the structure if this is chosen what should happen then and so on. In the meantime I googled if I was unsure of something and also used inspect in the browser to see how the code behaved when running and see what errors I would get.
I also did some rubber ducking both with myself and to a friend.

If I had more time I would have wanted to do it in a more realistic way of how this normally is implemented and not use alert and prompt.
