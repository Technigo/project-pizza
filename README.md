# Project Name

This week was my first time coding in JS, and it was a great start! 
This project is a JS pizzeria, where you can "order" from a menu by navigating through interactive windows in the browser.

## The problem

The main problem was starting from zero to learn the different data types in JS, how to use them, and implement them...
I did follow Technigo's recommendations as well as ChatGPT as a consistent assistant. 
I see the improvement I have done using VSC shortcuts, and this is making my coding experience much more comfortable and enjoyable.

In this practice, we used some data types like variables, if, else if, else, switch, and some methods. 
I look forward to knowing more about arrays, functions, and objects and how to implement them.
