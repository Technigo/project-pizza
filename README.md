# Project Name

Create a simple food ordering system in js, by following the instructions.

## The problem

I followed the instructions, using conditional if statements. First I used switch before I realised that would be a stretch.
Will create a separate switch version. 

Will also make an attempt with more loops for validation, in case the user input is incorrect.

Before hand in I will go through it again to make it DRY and more clean.
