# Project Name

This project is a small introduction to a JavaScript language. This Pizzeria Ordering System is an interactive web-based application that guides "clients" through customising their food order. It prompts users to input their name, choose between pizza, pasta, or salad, and select specific dish types like Margherita or Caesar Salad. The system also requests the user's age to determine whether to prepare a child-sized or adult-sized portion, then asks for final order confirmation using "Yes" or "No." The project demonstrates basic JavaScript functions, input handling, and conditional logic.

## The problem
To implement the system, I used vanilla JavaScript, focusing on the use of prompt() and alert() for user interaction. The logic was built using functions and conditional statements (such as if/else) to control the flow based on user inputs. I structured the project around functions to modularise different tasks like selecting food type and confirming the order, ensuring the program remained organised and easy to follow (which was A struggle).
If I had more time, I would enhance the project by adding error handling for invalid inputs, refining the UI to replace the basic prompt() and alert() boxes with more visually appealing forms, and perhaps implementing a responsive design using HTML and CSS.
