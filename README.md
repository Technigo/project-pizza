# Project Pizza

Made a pizza order bot with if/else logic, and another pizzabot with switch logic as instructed in instructions.md

## The problem

added logic so the user couldn't break the flow with faulty input.
would have looked into a way to add more orders than one if I would spend more time on this. Would also see if I could not repeat myself as much.
