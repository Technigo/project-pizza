## The problem

I had problems understanding the structures of the whole code in terms of when to close/open with curly brackets {}. Sometimes I had to put the code in CodePen in order to get help. I put my code in ChatGPT and asked if it could simplify my code. The next step would be to play with that in order to understand it properly. The next thing I would do is to understand how to add a while loop that makes the user go back to the choices if invalid option.
