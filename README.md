# Project pizza

The assigment was to build a javaScript Pizzaria using basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditionals and native methods.

## The problem

I had the instructions file open i the right pane at all times to make sure that I followed the instructions correctly. When there's a step-by-step instruction i try to take one step at a time to make sure that I don't miss anything.

When learning something new, I find myself spending a lot of time going through the material that were given to us, discussing with fellow students and searching the web for additional clearification. This was the first time I was writing JavaScript so I found all the steps difficult in it's own way.

One issue was to determine which conditional statement to use. With a litte research and a lot of discussions with a fellow student, we both tried out both statements. And it worked nicely!

There was an issue completing the project, I didn't realise that step 4 and 5 was connected together. So trying to get my head around that after a long day of work and studies wasn't easy. Couldn't have made it without my fellow students.

If I had more time I would like to add a footer to the page, to "own" it. I would also like to add an additional script as the stretch goals adresses and seperate the two conditional statements into different scripts.
