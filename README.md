# Project Name

Project to build a JavaScript Pizzaria, to exercise concepts like variables, conditionals, and native methods, prompting and alerting the user
in a simulation of a simple version of an online food order process.

## The problem

Created the code entirely with prompt and alerts, using "if...else" and switch conditional statements. Innitialized steps 1-4, and after code
was properly functional, after adding step 5, I also improved the code as possible, substituting part of previous codes to reduce code lines
and logic.
