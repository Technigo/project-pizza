# Project Name

The Pizzeria-bot assignment is an introduction to JavaScrips and meant to challenge and teach me how to use alerts (pop-up windows), write clean JS code, the use of variables and the use of data types - among many other new things regarding JS. The Assignment was divided into 5 steps with some sub-steps.

## The problem

After looking through all the provided material by Technigo I started by writing down each step and the requirement for each step on a post-it note each, to then lay them out on a row. This way I could focus on each post-it (step) without getting overwhelmed or being distracted by the other steps. When done, I flipped the post-it note and went on with the next post-it (step).

Step 1 and 2 felt pretty straight forward and simple, while step 3 got me into a position of thiking and scrathicng my head. After looking though different options of solving the problem I started trying out. I tried different approaches in CodePen until I was satisfied and copy/pasted it into VScode. The hardest part was figuring out how I initally wanted it to look, and how to make the code work, but when I finally uderstood it, the rest felt simple.

If I would have more time on my hands, I ould have worked more woth understanding everything, there are still many things that I don't understand. I wouls also make the code loop when incorrect answers were given, until the right one is entered.
