# Project Name
The assignment for this week was to create a Javascript pizzeria based on user inputs using methods like prompt and alert.

## The problem
During this week I approached many problems and it was hard to keep my head straight at times. I ended up trying stuff out and then deleting the code a few times to start over. I also got some help from a friend who's a programmer and he introduced me to functions in javascript. Afterwards I somehow ended up even more confused so I started over again and skipped using functions. Instead I used google, chatgpt and stack overflow to help me move forward. I also used the javascript pizzeria example on disco and took a lot of inspiration from that. Before I started coding I went to the example and tried to identify the different steps in the requirments and match them with the stages in the pizzeria example. 

If I had more time I would add while loops to my code to make sure the user has to choose an option before they leave for the next step or the page. In my code now the user has to refresh the page and start over if they would like to change something or picked the wrong option etc.
