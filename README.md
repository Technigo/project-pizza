# Restaurant ordering process

Excercise with javascript methods and variables to produce a "place order" process for a virtual restaurant.Working with conditional statements, alert and prompt methods.

## The problem

I had a problem on the stretch goals - the "break" inside some of my switch statements was not working, resulting on running the code even after false statement. After trying out different methods, I found the solution on nesting more "switch" statements in one.
For the final confirmation, after user confirm the age, I've created a switch statement which consider 2 expressions instead of the usual 1 (foodName and Age).
I've handeled to define every "default" case: When user type incorrect numbers, when user type into the age a letter as well, result will be an alert.

This was the scope of the "stretch goals" exercise but I find definitely more efficient to use "if", "else if" and "else" statements.

Tools I've used: lot of google search!!!
