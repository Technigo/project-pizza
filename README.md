# Pizzeria

This is Technigo's project for the first week. The premise is pretty simple: we have to create a 
pizzeria order page, getting the user's selection through JS prompts. 

## The problem

There's a very simple way of doing this. We could just do a series of if/else statements and/or
switch statements. I wanted to not hardcode anything in the code, so I stored the menu choices in
JS objects (stored in a separate file called variables.js). If we want to make changes to the menu,
we only need to update the menu choices in the variables.js file and the code should still work
as designed.
