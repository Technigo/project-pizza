# Project Pizza

This assignment was about learning JavaScript basics such as data types, variables and conditionals. The task was to create a pizzera handling customer orders. 

## The problem

I approached the problem by coding step by step. So after I finalised one step I pushed my progress to Github and then moved on to the next step.
The techniques I used to solve the problem was to take help from Google mostly, chat gpt and the provided course material.
Each time I sat down with the project I had different goals to complete different steps and if I did not solve them during that sitdown I wrote a note to continue with the problems I encountered. 

If I had more time I would continue with the stretch goals!
