# Javascript Pizzeria Project

This project is a JavaScript exercise that simulates an interactive experience at a virtual pizzeria. The goal of the project is to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts such as user prompts, conditional statements, and alerts.

## The Problem

The challenge was to create an interactive experience where users can make choices about their food order, including selecting the type of food, subtype, and specifying if it's for a child or an adult. The project involved using prompts to gather user input and then processing that input to provide appropriate responses and confirmation messages.

## Approach

To solve this problem, the following approach was taken:

1. **Welcome and Introduction:** The project starts with a welcoming message using the `alert()` method. The user is asked for their name using the `prompt()` method and greeted with a personalized message.

2. **Food Choice:** The user is presented with a menu of food options (Pizza, Pasta, Salad) using the `prompt()` method. The input is processed using a `switch` statement to determine the chosen food type.

3. **Subtype Choice:** Depending on the chosen food type, the user is prompted to select a subtype specific to that food type. Conditional statements are used to manage the subtypes for each food type.

4. **Age Specification:** The user is asked whether the food is intended for a child or an adult using the `prompt()` method. The program constructs an order message based on the user's input.

5. **Order Confirmation:** The user is presented with an order confirmation message including their choices and total cost. The user's confirmation is obtained using the `prompt()` method.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The main programming language used for logic and user interactions.
- HTML: The structure of the webpage.
- CSS: Basic styling for the webpage.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, the project could be enhanced by:

- Adding more food options and subtypes to provide a wider menu selection.
- Implementing additional error handling for unexpected inputs.
- Enhancing the styling of the user interface to improve the user experience.
