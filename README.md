# Project Name
Javascript Pizzeria
The goal was to create a service to order food with three different options and subtypes of those options.
Then determin what portion size the customer wants and then prompting the customer to confirm the order and finally recieving a confirmation of the order.

## The problem
I created two different solutions to solve the problem, one by using the if statement and one by using the switch statement.

I also wanted the code to be more bulletproof so I added the option to write the desired type of food instead of just writing the corresponding number.

If I had more time (and knowledge) I would probably create some kind of loop to give the user the poosibility to answer a question again if the choice as invalid. Instead of restarting the whole thing.
