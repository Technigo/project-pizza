# Project Name

Project Technigo Pizzaria. This is a JS based project which contains multiple version of JS files. They do the same thing,but how is different. ( only one of Switch or If cases used files(switch-statement.js and if-statement.js), a boths cases used file(script.js), and refactored as much as possible version(switch.js).)

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

In the final version, which is switch.js, I tried to use as much as functions for reusability. However, when I was trying to make one function in order not to write the same code again and again, and I need to use parameter to make some small changes. But I was very confused about which could be parameters and which value could be returned. In general, I was so confused about how to rewrite my code with functions. It took me hours to rewrite, and googling and trying every possible solutions that I found in the Internet, I was gradually able to understand how to use functions to make a code tidier. I used console.log a lot to know which value is returning and assigning to.
I also had some problem with loop to validate an input if it is a valid one, and I think I misunderstood how while loop and do - while loop work. So first I tried to use do while loop, but it did't work well. So I chose to use only while loop, and with some more reserch in google, I was able to achieve my goal.

With this project, I didn't plan much. I started to write a programm which seemed to be working. And then, I realized that it could be interesting to programm some more variations, so I did with only if and only switch statements versions. Final version was my strech goal project. I tried not to write the same lines of code, and store them in reusable functions.

In this project, I used vanila JavaScript.

I would do more refactoring to make it more readble. Moreover, I would also like to add some features, such as ordering for multiple people, more choice options, being able to go back to a previous page, multiple language options, and delivery options( in which users can type their address and phone num, and order them to deliver)
