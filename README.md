# Javascript Pizzeria

Create an order flow for a pizzeria using basic JavaScript functions.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started off by reading all the course material available in Notion. Then I looked at the recording. I also searched for extra material to practice the basic concepts of JS. Before starting the project I read through the instructions and the stretch goals. I started writing my code, step by step and whenever I ran into problems I consulted ChatGPT to exmplain some concepts such as functions an methods but also to debug my code... attending to the team meeting was also very useful. I realised that it was easier to explain the code to someone. Verbalizing the code has proven to me at least, to be a good method do understand the logic behind it. that's also why I have tried to write comments to follow "my logic".
