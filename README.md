# Project Name

Used Javascript to create a pizzeria order program with alerts, prompts, if & if-else statements. Also tried switch statements in place of the if-else statements.
## The problem

I couldn't write my if-else statements into switch statements for question 3 maybe because my logic was not correct. So I wrote the switch statements not using the original logic.
