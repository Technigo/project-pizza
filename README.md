# Virtual Pizzeria Place

The assignment for this project was to build a program that based on the user´s input would determine the chosen food type and based on age create the appropriate order for a child or adult.

## The problem

It was a challenge to understand how to reset the prompt if the answer isn´t correct. I used while loop for each step to make sure the user will not have to start from the beginning of the order.
I also needed to set the variables outside of the loop for it to work.

Happy Coding!
