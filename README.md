# Project Name

The task was to familiarise ouselves with variables, conditionals, and native methods within JavaScript by coding an ordering system for a pizzeria.

## The problem

I have done some programming before, so I was already somewhat familiar with variables and if/else/else if statements. However, I had not seen the switch and ternary operators before. The description and examples on the Week 1 Notion page were very helpful and easy to understand. After finishing the assignment using if statments, I therefore decided to try out the stretch goalas in switchc.js, which was fun. 

With more time, I would have looked into how to write a version using arrays.
