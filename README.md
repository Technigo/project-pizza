# Project Pizza

Our objective was to get a grasp of fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, conditionals, and native methods.

## The problem

I watched the coding session video and the project page on Notion, and applied some of the techniques from that. And once again I've found W3Schools a good information source. If I had more time, I would give the option to change the dishes (extra Parmesan, etc.).
