# Project Name

In this weeks project I was tasked with creating a simple interactive webpage using JavaScript, beginning with displaying a welcome message using the alert() method. Follow the provided steps in the script.js file to guide me through the process of building the project.

## The problem

To approach this problem, I began by carefully reading the provided instructions and analyzing the steps outlined in the script.js file. My initial focus was on understanding how to use the alert() and prompt() method in JavaScript to display messages and store input from a user on the webpage.

For planning, I followed the sequential steps outlined in the script.js file, breaking down the task into manageable parts. The primary technologies used were JavaScript for adding interactivity with the alert() and prompt() method. If I had more time, my next steps would ipotentially br adding more dynamic elements using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.

I also made the strech goals, and in the switch.js file I tried out using ";". And I think I like to use ";" more than not to use them.
