# Project Name
Marias Pizza

The assignment was to create a site with JavaScript (my first approach to JavaScript on the boot camp) to include a bot on the page.  The main goal of the site is the introduction to JavaScript, not the layout. it's a basic site!

## The problem

Although I am on my Software engineers first course I don't have had JavaScript yet, I have had Java course as well as C+- language course (different but with variables, strings, arrays, etc on use) so I have a little background on this coding problems. 

If I will have had a little more time I would like to create a properly layouted bot (in a box, with the colors and the images, etc) as well as a fully web page (with all the menus and options). 

## View it live
