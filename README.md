# Project-Pizza

The assignment was to use javascript for pop-up-messages for a pizzeria, with different food and also different price depending on age. 

## The problem

I looked at the videos and was taking a lot of nots, when I run into problem I asked other students for help and just trying and trying over again until it worked the way I wanted to.
