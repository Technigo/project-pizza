# Pizza Project Vera

The assignment was to practice js, to use variables and create if/else statements and switch statements.

## The problem

I had some trouble with getting my code to run smoothly through the document, it got stuck after the second step. That was because I first made a function in the second step; I wanted to get that part of the code to run again if the user put in an invalid value. I had to take that part out, and then it ran just fine.
