# Project Name

This project includes creating a program that lets the user order pizza through prompts and alerts. The exercise is meant to practice using conditional statements and switch cases.

## The problem

I did not plan so much but started following the instructions directly applying what I learnt in class. Once I got to the subtype choice I needed to draw the different selections on paper to clarify the logic to myself. That worked well and I managed to complete the task.
