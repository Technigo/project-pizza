# Project Name
Building a simple Pizzeria using Javascript where the user interacts with prompts storing the inputs as variables. The user is to navigate through a simple order flow and recieve an order confirmation with details of the selected items.

## The problem
I started out working through the stages one by one ensuring that each step executed as it should. When one section would cause an error i re-wrote the code from sctarch for some extra practice of the syntax and logic.
The first version of the code contains "if else" statements as well as nested if statements with strict comparisons to make the code execute according to the brief. Once I had a working solution I started a new script file replacing as many "if else" statements with switch cases and arrays. If I had more time I would have liked to create proper text input fields and maybe add buttons to give more of a "submission form" type of feel.
