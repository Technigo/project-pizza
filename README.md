# Project Name

The project this week, and the first project in sprint 2, our task was to produce a Pizzeria bot, virtual online Pizzeria with the basic javascript that we studied during this week, using alerts and prompts. 

## The problem

I looked at Damiens video and used his example with the "alarm clock" as a basis. I had problems getting each step to work when I first tried using const instead of let and to move on to the next prompt or alert when making an incorrect input, such as choosing nr 4 instead of 1, 2, 3 which are the available options. 

Then I googled and got the response to use while loops. I tried that with some google help and Matildas instructions on the Thursday session and it worked out well. 

I have used let as variable and assigned empty strings as initial values to the variable. I have used while loops to check if the user's input is not one of the valid options by using === strict equality operator. I struggled with keeping my head straight with all the different meal choices, subtypes, portion sizes etc. 
  
If  √ç hade more time I would try to add more prompts and alerts such as more meal options and add a background image or hero, an order button and dig deeper into the JS basics and how to write less code but achieve the same.
