// I have used while loops and let before const, so the variable can change in the loop. I have also assigned empty strings. The empty string is useful since it doesn‚Äôt imply any pre-selection or default choice, which means the code will rely entirely on user input, in this case the different meal choices.  

// A while loop is a control flow structure in programming that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a given condition evaluates to true. The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop, and if the condition is false, the loop terminates.
